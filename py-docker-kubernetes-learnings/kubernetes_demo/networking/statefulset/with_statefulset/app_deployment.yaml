# main intention is to show each pod got its own PV
# the replication of mongo is out of scope, kindly refer mongo doc for that

# first define storage class
# kubectl apply -f /py-docker-kubernetes-learnings/kubernetes_demo/k8_with_volumes/storage_classes/local-path-storage.yaml

# docker build -t cbagade/stas:v11 .
# docker push cbagade/stas:v11
# kubectl apply -f mongo_deployment.yaml -f app_deployment.yaml
# observe pods for mongo, created by statefulset
# mongo pod is created 1 at a time and when existing one is in Running state , then only next is created
# kubectl get pods -w
# also see pvc and pv, 3 are created
# kubectl get pvc
# kubectl get pv

# each pod got its own PV
# unless replication is set, the data in 1 PV doesn't get replicate to other PVs

# write to 1st pod

#  curl --location 'http://localhost:30007/mongodb-0/api/v1/fruits' \
#   --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
#  --data '{"fruitName":"Apple","from":"Tamilnadu","nutrients":"Vitamin B, Vitamin K","price":"200.50","organic":true,"description":"An avocado is a bright green fruit with a large pit and dark leathery skin. They'\''re also known as alligator pears or butter fruit. Avocados are a favorite of the produce section. They'\''re the go-to ingredient for guacamole dips."}'

# verify
# curl 'http://localhost:30007/mongodb-0/api/v1/fruits'


# but if this is get from other PV, data won't come
# curl 'http://localhost:30007/mongodb-1/api/v1/fruits'

# kubectl delete -f mongo_deployment.yaml -f app_deployment.yaml
# kubectl delete all pvc
# ensure pods, services, pvc and pv are deleted
