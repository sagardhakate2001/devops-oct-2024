# variable holding numeric value as string and try some maths


# then do type conversion to number

orange_price = "88"
final_price = (1 - 0.10) * int(orange_price)
print(f"{final_price} is price discount")



# concatenate number to str with type conversion
# this might required say in a case where statement inside print is written in concatenate style
# Or similar cases where a string need to concatenate with number
