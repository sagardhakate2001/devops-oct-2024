# = will assign value and == will compare value
# boolean condition can be test with >= or != or <=


# comparison in list for elements
# == compares elements in list
# elements are always compared in order, if order differs , lists are not equals ( == )


fruits_1 = ["orange","banana"] 
fruits_2 = ["orange","banana"] 

print(f"{fruits_1 == fruits_2} compare elemenst")

fruits_1 = fruits_2

print(f"{fruits_1 is fruits_2} compare reference")

# there is another keyword to is i.e., is, which compares location of list stored in memory
# list_1 is list_2 will compare memory location where list are stored


# say declaring 2 list, how can they result in pointing to same memory location ??
