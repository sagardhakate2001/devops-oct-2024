# Flask is light weight web application framework
# Flask-RESTful is an extension for Flask
# that adds support for quickly building REST (REpresentational State Transfer) APIs
# Easy to get started with REST API (lacks advanced functionality from full-fledged framework like Django)

# virtualenv avoids the need to install Python packages globally. 
# When a virtualenv is active, pip will install packages within the environment
# which flask (this command gives you flask as global package)

# perform these steps on VSC terminal to install venv

# rm -rf venv
# sudo apt install python3.11-venv
# python3.11 -m venv .venv
# python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
# source .venv/bin/activate
# you should see (.venv) prepended on VSC terminal

# pip install --upgrade pip
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# which flask (this time it will give path from local environment, which is .venv)

# Ctrl + Shift + P
# Python: Select interpreter
# .venv/bin/python3.11

# if you want to come out of .vnev on ubuntu cli
# deactivate

# import flask
