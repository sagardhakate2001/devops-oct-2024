# tupple is very similar to list but instead square brackets it uses normal brackets
# immutable and cannot be changed
# items are ordered and allow duplicates


fruits = ("orange","apple","grape")

# declaring tupple and printing

# tupples are ordered collection 


# tupples can't be modified



# looping through with for loop
for fruits_name in fruits:
